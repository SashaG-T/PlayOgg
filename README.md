# OpenAL Basics
This project was done with the usage of the OpenAL documentation. If you're looking to learn about the OpenAL API then I would recommend reading their documentation as it was quiet comprehensible.

# Compiling
OpenAL is required for compilation. Linking agains libogg, libvorbis and libvorbisfile are needed.

The project was written on a Windows based system but there is nothing too platform specific that would prevent easy portability.

# Usage
PlayOgg: [filename]
  -Play an OGG audio file named 'filename'
